## Chart Repository

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

### Searching for charts

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add myrepo https://jenkins-x-charts.github.io/repo/

you can search the charts via:

    helm search repo myfilter

## View the YAML

You can browse the [Chart repository directly](https://jenkins-x-charts.github.io/repo/) a look at the underlying charts YAML at: [index.yaml](https://jenkins-x-charts.github.io/repo/index.yaml)
